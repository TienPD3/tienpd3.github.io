Understanding who the stakeholders are, the impact of proposed changes on them, and the influence they may have on the change is vital to understanding what needs, wants, and expectations must be satisfied by a solution. If stakeholders are not identified, the business analyst may miss uncovering critical needs. Stakeholder needs uncovered late will often require a revision to business analysis tasks that are either in progress or are completed.

In addition, stakeholders may (intentionally or unintentionally) indicate priority to influence the result to their desired outcome.

They indicate something that is necessarily true (or untrue) about some concept, thereby supplementing its definition. In contrast to behavioural rules, which are about the behaviour of people, definitional rules represent operational knowledge of the organization. Definitional rules cannot be violated but they can be misapplied. An example of a definitional rule is: 'A customer must be considered a Preferred Customer if they place more than 10 orders per month.' Definitional rules often prescribe how information may be derived, inferred or calculated based on information available to the business. An inference or calculation may be the result of multiple rules, each building on something inferred or calculated by some other(s). Sets of definitional rules are often used to make operational business decisions during some process or upon some event. 'An example of a calculation rule is: An order's local jurisdiction tax amount must be calculated as (sum of the prices of all the order's taxable ordered items) × local jurisdiction tax rate amount.'

Requirements that are represented in a general manner, without direct ties to a particular tool or organizational structure, tend to be more reusable. These requirements are also less subject to revision during a change. As requirements are expressed in more detail, they become more tightly associated with a specific solution or solution option. Specific references to applications or departments limit the reuse of requirements and designs across an organization. Requirements that are intended for reuse reflect the current state of the organization. Stakeholders validate the proposed requirements for reuse before they can be accepted into a change."
