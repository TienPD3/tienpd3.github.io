A business analyst is any person who performs business analysis tasks described in the BABOK® Guide, no matter their job title or organizational role. Business analysts are responsible for discovering, synthesizing, and analyzing information from a variety of sources within an enterprise, including tools, processes, documentation, and stakeholders. The business analyst is responsible for eliciting the actual needs of stakeholders—which frequently involves investigating and clarifying their expressed desires—in order to determine underlying issues and causes. Business analysts play a role in aligning the designed and delivered solutions with the needs of stakeholders."

Stakeholders might still participate in the research.Research can include data analysis of historical data to identify trends or past results. • Experiments: involves identifying information that could not be known without some sort of controlled test.

    "explanation": "BABOK Page 85, 5.2.4.3 Reusing Requirements 'Requirements at high levels of abstraction may be written with limited reference to specific solutions. Requirements that are represented in a general manner, without direct ties to a particular tool or organizational structure, tend to be more reusable. These requirements are also less subject to revision during a change. As requirements are expressed in more detail, they become more tightly associated with a specific solution or solution option. Specific references to applications or departments limit the reuse of requirements and designs across an organization. Requirements that are intended for reuse reflect the current state of the organization. Stakeholders validate the proposed requirements for reuse before they can be accepted into a change."

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Identify Improvement OpportunitiesWhen proposing design options, a number of opportunities to improve the operation of the business may occur and are compared.Some common examples of opportunities include: Increase Efficiencies: automate or simplify the work people perform by re-engineering or sharing processes, changing responsibilities, or outsourcing. Automation may also increase consistency of behaviour, reducing the likelihood of different stakeholders performing the same function in distinctly different fashions. Improve Access to Information: provide greater amounts of information to staff who interface directly or indirectly with customers, thereby reducing the need for specialists. Identify Additional Capabilities: highlight capabilities that have the potential to provide future value and can be supported by the solution. These capabilities may not necessarily be of immediate value to the organization (for example, a software application with features the organization anticipates using in the future)."

      "C": "Distribute",
      "D": "Extend"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "There are two commonly used relationships between use cases: Extend: allows for the insertion of additional behavior into a use case. The use case that is being extended must be completely functional in its own right and must not depend on the extending use case for its successful execution. This relationship may be used to show that an alternate flow has been added to an existing use case (representing new requirements). Include: allows for the use case to make use of functionality present in another use case. The included use case does not need to be a complete use case in its own right if it is not directly triggered by an actor. This relationship is most often used either when some shared functionality is required by several use cases or to abstract out a complex piece of logic."
