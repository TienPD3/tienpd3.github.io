      "D": "Define change strategy, analyze current state, prioritize requirements"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Identify Improvement OpportunitiesWhen proposing design options, a number of opportunities to improve the operation of the business may occur and are compared.Some common examples of opportunities include: Increase Efficiencies: automate or simplify the work people perform by re-engineering or sharing processes, changing responsibilities, or outsourcing. Automation may also increase consistency of behaviour, reducing the likelihood of different stakeholders performing the same function in distinctly different fashions. Improve Access to Information: provide greater amounts of information to staff who interface directly or indirectly with customers, thereby reducing the need for specialists. Identify Additional Capabilities: highlight capabilities that have the potential to provide future value and can be supported by the solution. These capabilities may not necessarily be of immediate value to the organization (for example, a software application with features the organization anticipates using in the future). "

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "There are two commonly used relationships between use cases: Extend: allows for the insertion of additional behavior into a use case. The use case that is being extended must be completely functional in its own right and must not depend on the extending use case for its successful execution. This relationship may be used to show that an alternate flow has been added to an existing use case (representing new requirements). Include: allows for the use case to make use of functionality present in another use case. The included use case does not need to be a complete use case in its own right if it is not directly triggered by an actor. This relationship is most often used either when some shared functionality is required by several use cases or to abstract out a complex piece of logic."
