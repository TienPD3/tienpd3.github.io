        "explanation": "Definitional rules shape concepts, or produce knowledge or information. They indicate something that is necessarily true (or untrue) about some concept, thereby supplementing its definition. In contrast to behavioural rules, which are about the behaviour of people, definitional rules represent operational knowledge of the organization. Definitional rules cannot be violated but they can be misapplied. An example of a definitional rule is: 'A customer must be considered a Preferred Customer if they place more than 10 orders per month.' Definitional rules often prescribe how information may be derived, inferred or calculated based on information available to the business. An inference or calculation may be the result of multiple rules, each building on something inferred or calculated by some other(s). Sets of definitional rules are often used to make operational business decisions during some process or upon some event. 'An example of a calculation rule is: An order's local jurisdiction tax amount must be calculated as (sum of the prices of all the order's taxable ordered items) × local jurisdiction tax rate amount.'

Sources of business rules may be explicit (for example, documented business policies, regulations, or contracts) or tacit (for example, undocumented stakeholder know-how, generally accepted business practices, or norms of the corporate culture). Business rules should be explicit, specific, clear, accessible, and single sourced. Basic principles for business rules include: • basing them on standard business vocabulary to enable domain subject matter experts to validate them, • expressing them separately from how they will be enforced, • defining them at the atomic level and in declarative format, • separating them from processes they support or constrain, • mapping them to decisions the rule supports or constrains, and • maintaining them in a manner such that they can be monitored and adapted as business circumstances evolve over time. A set of rules for making an operational business decision may be expressed as a decision table or decision tree, as described in Decision Analysis (p. 261). The number of rules in such a set can be quite large, with a high level of complexity"

        "explanation": "BABOK3 Page 305,306 10.31 Observation There are two basic approaches for observation: • Active/Noticeable: while observing an activity the observer asks any questions as they arise. Despite this interruption to the work flow, the observer can more quickly understand the rationale and hidden processes underlying the activity, such as decision making. A variation of this method may involve even stronger intervention into actors' activities by stimulating them to perform specific tasks. This kind of facilitated observation allows focus on the observer's objectives in order to shorten observation time or elicit specific information. • Passive/Unnoticeable: during the activity the observer does not interrupt the work. Any concerns are raised once the observation is over. This allows observation of a natural flow of events without intervention by the observer, as well as measurement of the time and quality of work. A variation of this method is video recording the activity and then reviewing it with the person being observed so they may provide further clarification. Inspection of a person's work environment helps in discovering any tools and information assets involved in performing their activities. This supports understanding of the activities, especially with the purpose of identifying needs and opportunities. This kind of observation is an important part of the technique's variation, and is known as Contextual Inquiry."

There are always events or conditions that could increase or decrease the actual value if they occur. Many changes are proposed in terms of intangible or uncertain benefits, while costs are described as tangible, absolute, and might grow. When benefits are described as intangible and costs expressed as tangible, it may be difficult for decision makers to compare their options. Business analysts define a complete estimate of the purpose-driven and monetary effects of a proposed change by considering the tangible and intangible costs alongside the tangible and intangible benefits. The estimate of costs and benefits must take into account the degree of uncertainty pertaining at the time the estimates are made."
